# ToolTalk

ToolTalk is the message bus of the desktop. `ttsession` runs once for a session.
Programs connect to it over ONC RPC, register the messages they handle and send
messages that it routes; it starts the program of an installed ptype when a
message needs a handler that is not running. Everything a client sends reaches
`ttsession` as RPC arguments, and the daemon decodes them before it knows who
sent them.

## Request decoding

- Strings, byte strings and lists of strings with a negative length or count, or
  a length beyond the data that arrived, are refused. This includes the session
  cookie, which is decoded before it is checked, and every string of a message.
- Session addresses are read within the size of their fields: a long host name no
  longer overruns the buffers that hold it.
- A null object where a procedure needs one, a truncated body and arguments that
  cannot be decoded are answered with an error. A failed decode does not go on
  into the procedure, and what it allocated is freed.
- Loading types into a running session leaves the live type table alone when the
  database cannot be read. Looking up the children of an object type finds the
  types it should, and a cycle of parent types ends instead of looping.
- The session cookie is drawn from `/dev/urandom` and nothing else. If the random
  source cannot be read, no session starts.

## Checks

`make -C lib/tt/slib check` compiles the production decoding and request code
with the sanitizers next to a test program and runs each case in its own
process. The program builds its requests by hand, with lengths and null markers
that libtt never produces, and serves them through the dispatcher `ttsession`
uses.
